# Unofficial-Nokia-phones-bug-tracker
This is an experiment to try and collect and gather information on bugs with HMD Global's Nokia phones - a kind of unofficial bug tracker. This is for the benefit of the owners of these phones to help us show HMD what needs to be fixed. We will focus on software, although significant hardware faults may also be tracked.
